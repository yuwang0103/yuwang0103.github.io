## Abstract

Recent years have witnessed a significant shift from just model-centric AI, which focuses on developing top-performing models, to also data-centric AI, which emphasizes the quality and refinement of the data used in AI models with most of these efforts in computer vision and natural language processing domains (i.e., image and text). Concurrently, graph machine learning (GML), such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has emerged as a rising approach for analyzing graph-structured data by fusing the topological information via message-passing and the feature information via neural transformation. Despite GML's unprecedented success in pushing the boundary of state-of-the-art performance in graph-based tasks, its strong dependence on node features and graph topology also makes it vulnerable to data-quality issues, which can catastrophically impair GML performance. On the one hand, graph-structured data, like many other data modalities, suffer from conventional data-quality issues, e.g., imbalance and bias. On the other hand, the intrinsic complex and abstract nature of graph topology can potentially exacerbate the aforementioned issues and brings up new ones. For example, the imbalance issue that initially happens at the quantitative level could also occur at the topological level. The inherent bias encoded in the sensitive feature space might get amplified after the message passing in GNNs. These issues severely impair downstream task performance and are challenging to diagnose due to graphs' inherent complexity and abstraction. In view of the criticality and ubiquity of the graph-data quality issues in compromising GML performance, our tutorial aims to make a timely contribution by sensitizing the graph ML community towards graph data-quality issues while (1) introducing the background and motivation behind GML,  (2) giving a bird's eye view of existing graph-data quality issues, (3) selectively presenting representative works in studying/solving these issues, and (4) discussing crucial challenges for future work.
